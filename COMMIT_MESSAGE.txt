Add SFTP support with SSH authentication and network operators (v0.12.0)

This release adds comprehensive SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) support for
secure remote file operations using Parsley's existing network I/O operators.

Key Features:
• SFTP() builtin factory creates persistent SSH connections with caching
• SSH key authentication (preferred) and password authentication support
• Network operators: <=/= (read), =/=> (write), =/=>> (append)
• All format accessors work over SFTP: .json, .text, .csv, .lines, .bytes, .file, .dir
• Directory operations: .mkdir(), .rmdir(), .remove() with recursive options
• Path-first syntax matches local file I/O: conn(@/path).format
• Error capture pattern: {data, error} <=/= conn(@/file).json
• Connection lifecycle management with .close() method
• known_hosts verification for security
• Configurable timeouts and connection options

Implementation:
• Added SFTPConnection and SFTPFileHandle types with connection pooling
• Integrated SFTP into evalFetchStatement() and evalWriteStatement()
• Connection caching by user@host:port for efficiency
• Support for SSH_FXF_APPEND flag for append operations
• Directory listing returns file metadata (name, size, modified, isDir)

Dependencies:
• Added github.com/pkg/sftp v1.13.10
• Upgraded golang.org/x/crypto to v0.45.0

Testing:
• 12 comprehensive test suites in sftp_test.go
• Syntax verification for all SFTP operations
• Coverage for authentication, formats, operators, and directory ops

Documentation:
• Complete SFTP section in docs/reference.md (250+ lines)
• Full demo script: examples/sftp_demo.pars
• README.md updated with SFTP quick start
• CHANGELOG.md entry with implementation notes
• Design plan and verification documents

Security Model:
• No special security flags (aligns with HTTP/Fetch pattern)
• SFTP operates on remote resources, not local filesystem
• SSH keys read from standard ~/.ssh/ location

This implementation follows the connection-based pattern (like databases) rather
than stateless requests (like HTTP) because SSH sessions are expensive to create
and SFTP requires maintained state for directory operations.
