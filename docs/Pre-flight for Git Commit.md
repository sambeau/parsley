## PRE-FLIGHT for Git Commit

### Prepare for major git commit:
If you haven't already done it, can you: 
 - increment VERSION
 - create comprehensive, complete tests: any extra tests, only if no tests have been created or if extra tests are needed
 - move any tests out of root directory - tests belong in tests/
 - make minor updates to the README.md 
 - make comprehensive changes to the docs/reference.md
 - update CHANGELOG.md
 - If matching task in docs/TODO.md, strikethrough, add tick and version, then move to APPROVED
 - If this is a major grammar change, update the .vscode-extension
 - suggest a comprehensive summary for git commit summary
