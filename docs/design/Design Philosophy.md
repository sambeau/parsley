## Parsley Core Design Philosophy

- When adding a feature we need to adhere to Parsley's design aesthetic: simplicity, minimalism, `type-completeness`, and composability. Are there languages that manage this language feature more elegantly than the standard approach? How would we create and use this featutr without requiring a multitude of built-in functions or methods?
- As Parsley is a concatenative language at heart, composibility and `type-completeness` are always a goal (though not alway acheivable). However, pragmatism and an easy-to-understand grammar and PIA are just as important.
- A consistent design language in the grammar and APIs for each feature is vital — new Parsley features should look like, feel liek, and connect seamlessly with existing features.
